                    Gadiyal Lohar : A journey from mainstream to nomadic life.
                </h1>
                <p style="font-size:26px; color: white;">
                    An attempt to document the life, culture and day-to-day activities of a nomadic community of India, called Gadia(Gadiyal) Lohar
                </p>
                <p style="font-size:20px; color: white;">
                    This is a research work done by Mr. Jeetendra Ajmera under the guidance of Dr Narendra Kumar. The community is also found in the Malwa region of Madhya Pradesh. They are lohar (ironsmith) by profession who move on from one place to another place on bullock carts, which in Hindi are called gadi, hence the name 'Gadia Lohar'. Their origin is shrouded in legend. Their forefathers were blacksmiths in the army of Maharana Pratap of Mewar. When Mewar fell to the Mughals they pledged never to return to their homeland and never to settle anywhere else until Rana's hegemony was restored. This project is to revive their culture and an attempt to bring them back to mainstream world through documentation and storytelling. <br><br>
